    <p><strong>Options are Good.</strong>
<strong>In life. And in your career.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What fuels your passion?</strong>
Whether you are just about to receive your diploma from University or have been in the industry for years, we know deciding where to start your career or how to move to the next opportunity can be as nerve-wracking as it is exciting. Maybe you don’t know exactly what you want to do. The good thing is, at Microsoft, you have lots of options. Nowhere else will you have such a variety of products and technologies to get behind—or so many career paths to choose from. You’ll learn from people who have been in the industry for over 30 years. And most of all, you’ll have the resources to reach people all over the world with your work. It’s about taking your career as far as you want it to go—in any direction you choose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The variety of products that Microsoft develops greatly influenced my decision to work here. As my career develops I can follow my passion to apply myself to different technologies without having to leave the company.”</p>

Not sure what full-time position at Microsoft fits you best? Have a look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/fyp_prodcycle.aspx">Product Development Process</a> to get an idea where your contributions could make the most difference.</p>
<p><strong>Software Design Engineer (SDE)</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>**Work at the Core of Every Product We Build **
This is where the fun begins for code gurus like you. As a hands-on Software Design Engineer, you’ll make decisions about design and feature implementation, using your mastery of technical tools to make a product vision a reality. If you like to write code and design efficient data structures and algorithms to develop next-generation applications or operating systems, this is the position for you. As an SDE, you’ll bring products to life by working with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_pm.mspx">Program Managers</a> to ensure strong design and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_softdesengtest.mspx">Software Design Engineers in Test</a> to ensure quality through testing. Ultimately for the SDE, it’s your code that turns concepts into new technologies and services.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be available to relocate to our corporate headquarters in Redmond, Washington, U.S.A. (Microsoft Corporation pays all costs associated with relocation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fluency in C/C++/C# and a passion for writing quality code using computer science fundamentals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to speak fluent English</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to derive creative and innovative solutions by thinking &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo;</p>

<p>Demonstrated skill in estimating development time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software Design Engineer in Test (SDET)</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>**Discover Life on the Last Line of Defense **
As a Software Design Engineer in Test (SDET), you’ll own it, break it, fix it, and own it again. You’ll ensure a product’s quality by making sure it performs as users expect it to. Part of the fun is how creative you can be devising ways to manipulate, crush, and sabotage software into submission—while creating innovative testing technologies along the way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as an SDET it’s your input that can make the difference between joy and frustration for the customers. Since you’re keen on how things work, and making them work better, you’ll work hand in hand with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_pm.mspx">Program Managers</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_softdeseng.mspx">Software Design Engineers</a> to design, develop, and maintain automation systems for use in development and testing cycles. Using the tools you create, you’ll pour over source code for trouble spots, debugging and isolating problems, and executing creative tests to find new bugs while regression testing recent fixes.</p>
